# Eaton UPS Integration for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration that connects to Eaton UPS devices through their Network-M2/M3 management card via MQTT to monitor power status and battery levels. This integration provides:

- Device Information
  - Model, serial number, firmware details
  - UPS operating mode and health status
  - System alarms and fault conditions

- Power Metrics
  - Input/Output voltage, current, and frequency
  - Active and apparent power measurements
  - Power factor and load percentage
  - Energy consumption statistics

- Battery Information
  - Charge level and remaining runtime
  - Charging status and mode (e.g., ABM)
  - Battery test results and health
  - Installation and replacement dates

- Environmental Monitoring
  - Temperature status
  - Fan and system alerts

## Requirements

- An Eaton UPS device with Network-M2 or Network-M3 management card
- TLS certificates (mandatory):
  - Server certificate for the Network-M card
  - Client certificate and private key for authentication
  - These must be uploaded to the Network-M card's web interface

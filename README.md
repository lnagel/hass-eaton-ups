# Eaton UPS Integration for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration that connects to Eaton UPS devices via MQTT to monitor power status, battery levels, and control UPS functions. This integration provides:

- Real-time monitoring of UPS status and measurements
- Battery status and health information
- Power input/output metrics
- Binary sensors for fault conditions
- Switches for controllable features

## Requirements

- An Eaton UPS device with MQTT capability
- MQTT broker configured with SSL certificates
- Home Assistant 2023.8.0 or newer

## Installation

1. Add this repository to HACS or copy the `custom_components/eaton_ups` folder to your Home Assistant configuration directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration through the Home Assistant UI
4. Configure with your UPS's MQTT connection details and certificates

## Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same
it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this "blueprint" that you think more
developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)
